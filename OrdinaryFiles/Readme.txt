This folder holds "divisions" and "ordinaries".
Most of the images are 223 x 215 pixels in size.

If adding more files:
    1) Just add file in, the program picks from the PNG files present.
    2) Do them in solid black and white and no other color (unless going to change the program).
       (The program switches the black then white to a random other color.)
    3) Remember that the images will be resized by the coat of arms generator, so can be any size.

Suggested enhancements:
    1) Tri-color patterns (such as top panel with split in half on lower section)
(But would require minor program change).
    2) Gryonny
    3) Semme Fleur-de-lis
    4) Ermine pattern
    5) Bendy of Ten
    6) Barry of Ten
    7) Semme of Crosslets
    8) Vair
    9) Paly of Nine
