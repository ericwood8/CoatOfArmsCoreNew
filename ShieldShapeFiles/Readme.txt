This folder has shield shapes in it.
Most images are 260 pixels by 275 pixels in total.

If adding new shield shapes:
   1) Just add file in, the program picks from the PNG files present.
   2) Do not use JPG files since you need transparency
   3) I suggest 260 by 275 pixels or larger.
   4) Have a minimal white space bordering the shield's edges and hopefully better centering.
   5) Put transparency in the center (because the program treats these as picture frames of sorts)

Suggested Enhancements: 
   1) Oval shields - would require extensive refactoring in code to handle
   2) Round shields - would require extensive refactoring in code to handle
